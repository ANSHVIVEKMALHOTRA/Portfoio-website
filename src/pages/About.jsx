            Hey, I’m Ansh.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m driven by curiosity and a genuine interest in understanding how things work and why they matter. I enjoy approaching problems with patience and depth, focusing not just on finding solutions, but on understanding the process behind them.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m currently studying Computer Science, where I’ve had the chance to work on a variety of academic and personal projects. These experiences have shaped the way I think: breaking complex ideas into simpler parts, refining them thoughtfully, and building things with purpose. I value clarity, consistency, and work that feels intentional rather than rushed.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m drawn to learning that lasts. Whether I’m exploring something new or strengthening what I already know, I try to stay grounded, curious, and open-minded. I believe progress comes from steady effort, thoughtful decisions, and a willingness to keep improving quietly and consistently.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of work, I enjoy reading, reflecting, and paying attention to the small details that often go unnoticed. Those moments of pause help me think clearly and work with intention. I believe meaningful growth doesn’t need to be loud, and I try to let that mindset guide how I learn, build, and move forward.
